#### Getting Started Guide : Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Custom Knowledge Base

Large language models like Gemini are incredibly powerful — but they can’t “remember” everything. Their knowledge stops at training time, and they can’t see your company’s internal docs, FAQs, or product manuals.

That’s where Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) comes in.

RAG allows your AI to fetch real information from a custom knowledge base before generating a response.

In this tutorial, we’ll build a minimal but complete RAG pipeline using Gemini and Pinecone.

### What Is a RAG System?

A RAG system has two parts:

**Retriever** – Finds the most relevant pieces of information from a knowledge base.

**Generator** – Uses that information to create a natural, factual answer.

Think of it like this:

The Retriever finds the right book page.

The Generator explains it in plain English.

This combination makes your AI system knowledge-aware and capable of answering domain-specific questions.

### Build Your Gemini + Pinecone RAG

#### Prerequisites

You’ll need:

A Google API key (for Gemini) → [Get one here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys)

A Pinecone API key → [Get one here](https://app.pinecone.io/)

Python 3.9+

Install the dependencies:

```   
pip install google-generativeai pinecone  
 ```

#### Summary Of How Code Works

##### Embedding Phase

Gemini’s gemini-embedding-001 turns each text chunk into a 3072-dimensional vector.

This captures the semantic meaning of your documents.

##### Storage Phase

We store these embeddings and metadata (the original text) inside Pinecone.

Pinecone makes it possible to do semantic search using vector similarity.

##### Retrieval Phase

When a user asks a question, we embed it too, and Pinecone returns the closest documents by meaning — not by keywords.

##### Generation Phase

The retrieved documents are combined into a context, which Gemini uses to generate a fluent, factual answer.

#### Final Thoughts

This is the core pattern behind modern enterprise AI apps — chatbots, internal knowledge assistants, documentation search, customer support bots, and more.

The best part?

You can start small with just a few text files and scale up to millions of documents without retraining your model.

Gemini finds meaning, Pinecone finds matches — together, they make your AI smarter.
