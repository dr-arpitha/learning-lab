Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for models to interact with their environment and exchange information. It defines a set of interfaces and conventions for managing context, such as input data, model parameters, and execution state. MCP aims to improve interoperability, reusability, and maintainability of models by establishing a common understanding of how context is handled.
